## About the Project
 Waste No More is an application dedicated to help people reduce food waste at home by tracking food items, expiration dates, and help locate the nearest donation centers for food close to expiring. Using the built in notification system, users will be notified for food about to be expired and resources are provided to educate users on food waste management, food storage and how to donate food. This project was created for the 2203 Backend Program Module 3 Consultancy Project.
